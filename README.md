Practice problems in different languages, to keep skills sharp and learn new languages.

## Why
I'm at the point professionally where I _know_ the solution, but can't always _spell it out_ in my non-favorite languages. So I see this as a fun way to widen my skill set.

## Questions
For now, all the questions have been sourced from the CodeWars.com website, however I have a generic version of their language specific test class, and will be using it for local development (because debuggers thanks).

## Languages

### Javascript
I will be using ES6 and adhering to the AirBnB javascript style guide.

### Python
I will be using Python 3.6+.

### PHP

### Java

### TypeScript

### C

## Practices
Although there are usually shorter solutions, I've personally found that the one line golf snippets are harder to write, maintain and don't ultimately run any faster. As such, most of my solutions will (hopefully) focus on being fast, clean, and extremely readable. If I don't know what every line does 6 months after writing it, I consider that a failure.

## Feedback
If you see a potential improvement in any of my work here, please let me know!
